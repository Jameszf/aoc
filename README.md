# AoC Solutions

This is a collection of my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. There are many solutions out there, but these solutions are mine. I try not to use reference material or look at hints. My solutions are not necessarily the "best" or the most efficient (space/time) for the given problem, however, they are designed to run reasonably well given the constraints on a 5 year old machine (my laptop). My goal is to use this problems as exercises to help me learn the fundamentals of different programming languages so I can tackle harder projects later on.

# Solutions

I do the problems in order from 1 to 25. A day is not "completed" unless I answer both parts of the day. Some solutions may not have code for part one (I probably overwrote it whilst making a solution for part two) and are generally uncommented. Nonetheless, I try to make the solutions as readable as I can with descriptive names and modular functions.
