# AOC Practice 

This is a collection of my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. There are many similar solutions out there, but these solutions are mine. I do not use any reference material nor do I try to come up with the "best" solution. My goal is to use this problems as exercises to help me learn the fundamentals of different programming languages so I can tackle harder projects later on.

# Solutions

I do the problems from 1 to 25 (no skipping). A day is not "completed" unless I answer both parts of the day. Some solutions may not have code for part one (I probably overwrote it whilst making a solution for part two).

| Year | Language | Completed (/25) | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2015 | Emacs Lisp | 12 |
| 2022 | Haskell | 8 |
